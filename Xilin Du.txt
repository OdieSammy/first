Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	
e.g.
select count(*)
from attribute

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo =10000
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years =2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	
e.g
select count (distinct id)
from business
e.g.
select count (distinct business_id)
from attribute


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select *
from user as u 
where u.id=null or u.name=null or u.review_count=null or u.yelping_since=null or u.useful=null or u.funny =null or u.cool =null or u.fans=null or u.average_stars=null or u.compliment_hot=null or u.compliment_more=null or u.compliment_profile= null or u.compliment_cute= null or u.compliment_list= null or u.compliment_note=null or u.compliment_plain=null or u.compliment_cool=null or u.compliment_funny=null or u.compliment_writer=null or u.compliment_photos=null
	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:3.7082
		
	select min(stars),max(stars),avg(stars)
	from review
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg:3.6549
		
	select min(stars),max(stars),avg(stars)
	from business
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:0.0144
		
	select min(likes),max(likes),avg(likes)
	from tip
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:1.9414
		
	select min(c.count),max(c.count),avg(c.count)
        from checkin c 
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:24.2995
	select min(review_count),max(review_count),avg(review_count)
	from user	


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Mesa is the city i chose,simply due to the shortlength
yes, the ones with higher rating tend to open longer hours

select b.city, h.hours
from business b inner join hours h  
on h.business_id=b.id
where (b.stars=4.0 or b.stars=4.5 or b.stars =5.0) and b.city ='Mesa'
order by h.hours

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
1957 reviews in total for 2-3 ratings
3775 reviews for 4-5 ratings

select sum(review_count)
from business b 
where (b.stars=4.0 or b.stars=4.5 or b.stars =5.0) and b.city ='Mesa' 

select sum(review_count)
from business b 
where (b.stars=2.0 or b.stars=2.5 or b.stars =3.0) and b.city ='Mesa' 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:
select b.city, h.hours,b.postal_code,c.category
from (business b inner join hours h  
on h.business_id=b.id)
inner join category c 
on c.business_id=b.id
where (b.stars=2.0 or b.stars=2.5 or b.stars =3.0) and b.city ='Mesa'
order by postal_code desc

**shops in the same area( postal code) tend to open and close around the same time
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: ones are closed are mainly in the hospitality area
         
         
ii. Difference 2:the ones closed have a slightly lower median stars rate than the ones are still open
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select c.category,b.neighborhood,count(b.neighborhood)
from category c inner join business b 
on c.business_id=b.id 
where b.is_open=0
group by b.neighborhood

select b.stars,count(b.stars)
from business b 
where b.is_open=1
group by b.stars	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
